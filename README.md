ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to IPCTEK's Github repository!

We are a group of highly-expert people passionate about the embedded world in general and the FPGA technology in particular.
We have many years of experience concerning Digital Signal Processing, FPGA IP development, FPGA firmware design, bare-metal 
and Linux driver development. We are familiar with high-speed IO, from Ethernet to PCie and DDR4.

In this Github repository we give you example designs and use cases in order to evaluate the IPCTEK's FPGA IPs. These designs,
in some cases, may also serve as a good starting point for your embedded projects. For details concerning our FPGA IPs, please
visit our website www.ipctek.net
